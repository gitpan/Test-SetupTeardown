* About Test-SetupTeardown

This module provides very simple support for xUnit-style C<setup> and
C<teardown> methods.  It is intended for developers who want to ensure
their testing environment is in a known-good state before running
their tests, and is left in an known-rather-okay state after.

* About the authors

This distribution was originally written by Uperto for SFR, a French
ISP and telecom.
